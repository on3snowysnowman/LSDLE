# Version 1.0.3

  - Configured SpriteHandler to have a sprite size multiplier for changing
    the size output of sprites  

  - Added a Coordinate.h file that provides a basic Coordinate class for 
    storing two uint16_ts

  - Reconfigured SpriteHandler to use a DataContainer for storing the 
    rendering data for sprites so that a single sprite can now be rendered
    multiple times to the screen in one frame

  - Added docstring to JsonLoader

  - Added the 'const' and 'final' modifier to many functions where it was
    applicable

  - Fixed issue where some methods still called the old "does_file_exist"
    name from the Debug class.
  
  - Updated the documentation inside the MenuToolItem and their derived 
    class's files.

  - Updated the documentation inside the LSDLE.h file

# Version 1.0.2

  - Renamed the Debug's "does_file_exist" method to "does_directory_exist" 
    to better reflect its function.

# Version 1.0.1

  - Tweaked the way Sprites are created. The Sprites will now be created from
    the SpriteHandler, with each Sprite containing purely the source and 
    destination data along with its texture. Sprites created by themselves 
    will not contain a valid texture
  
  - Reconfigured the privacy of some members in the LSDLE itself. Added get 
    methods to the engine for retrieving screen width and height

# Version 1.0 

  - Release Version.
